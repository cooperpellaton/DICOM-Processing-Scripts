# Event File Generation

## Overview
This script accepts tab seperated log files generated by Psychopy as the result of experiments, and produces "Event Files" for use during analysis. This script is capable of producing Motor and General Event Files. 

## Assumptions
This data assumes a `TR` of 1.5 seconds, as well as a production of 247 dicom images per scanner run. These assumptions are solidified in the [cheatsheet](sample_files/FH_Word-TR-Cheat-Sheet.xlsx).

## Current State
Given a tab seperated log file, the script currently returns this data for analysis:

This is the event onset time realigned to each run by TR, and now in correct sequencial order for data analysis. Notice that the difference between this data and the raw data is that the event onset times now occur seperate from the break during our scanner runs, meaning this data now exists in a contiguous time space.
