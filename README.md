# Dicom Processing Scripts

This is a library of scripts currently in use at Georgia Tech's Center for Advanced Brain Imaging ([CABI](http://cabiatl.com/)) for processing and manipulating neuroimaging related data.

There is active development on a replacement for many of these `.csh` and `C++` utilities to try and phase out older, unsupported software and replace it with an automated pipeline to make the lives of researchers easier.

More information, and a proper guide will be released soon.
